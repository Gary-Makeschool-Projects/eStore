## To get up and running:

-   If you don't have pipenv, install it with `brew install pipenv`.
-   Clone the directory, `cd` into it, and then run `pipenv shell` followed by `pipenv install`
-   Set your environment variables: `export FLASK_ENV=development`
-   Run the command `flask run` or `python3 store.py` and everything should work!
